LINEAR REGRESSION ALGORITHM

The linear regression model is being used to predict the possible exam score of a given student given his/her study hours after learning from the data given to it.The goal of the algorithm is to find the optimal weight and bias terms which gives the minimum mean square error.This is done in the gradient descent function.
